# Data Analysis on Titanic Passenger Data

## Overview

This project is an exercise in data analysis using the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains detailed information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank after colliding with an iceberg on its maiden voyage. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover patterns and insights related to survival rates.

## Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset is provided in CSV format and includes the following columns:

1. **PassengerId** – Unique identifier for each passenger.
2. **Survived** – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
3. **Pclass** – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
4. **Name** – Full name of the passenger.
5. **Sex** – Gender of the passenger.
6. **Age** – Age of the passenger.
7. **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
8. **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard.
9. **Ticket** – Ticket number.
10. **Fare** – Fare paid for the ticket.
11. **Cabin** – Cabin number (if known).
12. **Embarked** – Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Steps for Analysis

### 1. Load and Explore the Data

- Import the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first few rows and generate summary statistics.
- Identify and handle any missing values appropriately.

### 2. Data Visualization

- Create visualizations to explore key variables such as age, passenger class, gender, and fare.
- Generate a **pie chart** to illustrate the survival distribution by age.
- Use a **histogram** to analyze the age distribution of passengers.

### 3. Data Analysis and Interpretation

- Examine the correlation between **passenger class** and **survival rate**.
- Investigate the impact of **gender** on survival likelihood.
- Analyze how the number of **siblings/spouses (SibSp)** and **parents/children (Parch)** aboard affected survival chances.
- Explore the relationship between **fare paid** and **survival probability**.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates on the Titanic. The findings from this project can help demonstrate the power of data analysis in understanding real-world historical events.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

For further improvements, additional machine learning techniques can be applied to predict survival probabilities based on passenger attributes.

### Extensions Procured

- **markdownlint** Because I really like a nice markdown README file.
